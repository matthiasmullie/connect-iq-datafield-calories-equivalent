A simple data field to let you know how many calories you've burned so far... in a more meaningful way!

105 kcal doesn't mean anything to me! Oh - that's 1 banana?

And 245 is a waffle? Interesting!

I guess I'll keep working out until I've burned a hot dog or two!

This may not be the most insightful app you'll find, but it sure is a lot of fun (and motivational)
